# Football Analysis Project

This repository contains code and analysis related to football, inspired by the book "Learn to Code with Football" by Nathan Brown.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **Walkthrough**: This folder contains a detailed walkthrough of the methods and techniques presented in Nathan Brown's book. It serves as a guide and reference for those who are following along with the book or for anyone interested in understanding the foundational methods of football analysis using code.

2. **vector_db**: This is a project focused on player similarity and ranking. Using advanced techniques and the FAISS library, this project aims to compare player performances and identify which players have similar playing styles or statistics. It's an exploration into the world of vector databases and high-dimensional similarity search in the context of football.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, and FAISS. You can install them using pip:

2. **Clone the Repository**: 
git clone https://github.com/LLove01/football


3. **Navigate to the Desired Folder**:
- For the book walkthrough:
  ```
  cd football_project/Walkthrough
  ```
- For the player similarity project:
  ```
  cd football_project/vector_db
  ```

4. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks as per your requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or other suggestions, please fork the repository and create a pull request. Ensure your code is well-documented and includes necessary comments.

## Acknowledgments
